This is a case study that I performed after analysing the conversartional AI in restaurant sector.
Purpose of AI and Robotic Integration : 
Enhance Robot Functionality : 
• Current use is only limited to trash collection .  
• Potential to expand usage to order taking, food delivery, and customer interaction. 
Improve Conversational AI :  
• Currently answers only  basic questions.  
• It can be upgradable to manage reservations , collect payments and offer personalized 
recommendations.
